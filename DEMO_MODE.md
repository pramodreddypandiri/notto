# Demo Mode - Testing Without Backend

## What is Demo Mode?

Demo Mode allows you to test the full UI/UX of the app without needing to configure Supabase, Claude API, or any backend services. It uses hardcoded sample data to simulate the app's behavior.

## Current Status

✅ **Demo Mode is ENABLED** by default in both screens.

## How It Works

### Home Screen (Voice Notes)
- **Sample notes** are displayed automatically (bowling, Mexican food, email Jack)
- **Voice recording** works - you can record audio
- **New notes** are added to the list when you stop recording (demo data, not saved)
- No backend calls are made

### Plans Screen (Weekend Plans)
- Click **"Generate Plans"** to see sample weekend plans
- Two demo plans are shown:
  - Saturday Evening Adventure (bowling + Mexican food + dessert)
  - Sunday Afternoon Chill (bowling + tacos)
- **Feedback buttons** work and show confirmation (not saved)
- 1.5 second simulated loading delay for realism

### Settings Screen
- All UI elements are functional
- Location can be typed in (not saved in demo mode)
- No authentication required

## Files Modified

### `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (Home Screen)
```typescript
const DEMO_MODE = true; // Line 15

const DEMO_NOTES = [
  // Sample notes data
];
```

### `app/(tabs)/plans.tsx` (Plans Screen)
```typescript
const DEMO_MODE = true; // Line 15

const DEMO_PLANS = [
  // Sample weekend plans
];
```

## Switching to Real Backend

When you're ready to connect to the real backend:

### Step 1: Configure Backend Services
1. Set up Supabase credentials in `config/supabase.ts`
2. Add Claude API key in `services/claudeService.ts`
3. Set up authentication (create auth screens)

### Step 2: Disable Demo Mode
Change both files:
```typescript
// In app/(tabs)/index.tsx
const DEMO_MODE = false; // Change to false

// In app/(tabs)/plans.tsx
const DEMO_MODE = false; // Change to false
```

### Step 3: Test Real Integration
- Users will need to sign up/login
- Notes will be saved to Supabase
- Plans will be generated by Claude AI
- All data will persist

## Benefits of Demo Mode

✅ **Test UI/UX immediately** - No backend setup required
✅ **Share with stakeholders** - Show the vision without complexity
✅ **Develop frontend** - Build UI while backend is being configured
✅ **Quick iterations** - Test design changes instantly
✅ **No API costs** - No Claude API or database calls

## Testing Checklist

### Home Screen
- [ ] App loads with 3 sample notes
- [ ] Tap microphone button → turns red (recording state)
- [ ] Tap again to stop → new note appears at top of list
- [ ] Notes show timestamps and summaries
- [ ] "Plan My Weekend" button navigates to Plans tab

### Plans Screen
- [ ] Empty state shows "Ready to plan your weekend?"
- [ ] Tap "Generate Plans" → loading spinner for 1.5 seconds
- [ ] Two plan cards appear with activities
- [ ] Each plan shows title, date, time range
- [ ] Activities show time, name, address, duration
- [ ] Reasoning section explains the plan
- [ ] Thumbs up/down buttons show confirmation alert

### Navigation
- [ ] Bottom tabs switch between screens
- [ ] Tab icons highlight when active
- [ ] Navigation is smooth and instant

### Settings Screen
- [ ] Can type in city field
- [ ] "Save Location" button works (shows confirmation in real mode)
- [ ] UI is clean and organized

## What Still Shows Errors?

When demo mode is ON, you'll still see these console warnings/errors (they're safe to ignore):

- `Failed to get notes` - Normal, we're using demo data instead
- `Failed to parse note` - Normal, no Claude API calls in demo mode
- `Not authenticated` - Normal, no auth required in demo mode
- `SafeAreaView deprecated` - Expo SDK update needed (non-critical)
- `expo-av deprecated` - Should migrate to expo-audio (future task)

These errors don't affect functionality in demo mode!

## Next Steps

After testing the UI in demo mode:

1. **Option 1: Voice Transcription** - Integrate OpenAI Whisper
2. **Option 2: Authentication** - Build sign up/login flow
3. **Option 3: Backend Setup** - Configure Supabase and Claude API
4. **Option 4: Google Places API** - Add real place search

**Demo mode lets you experience the full app flow right now!** 🎉

Just run:
```bash
npx expo start
```

Then press `i` for iOS or `a` for Android to see it in action.
